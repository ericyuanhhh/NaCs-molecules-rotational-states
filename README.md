# NaCs-molecules-rotational-states
Using a python package called Diatomic-py (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108512), I calculated the rotational transition of NaCs molecules including the transition dipole moment, frequencies and their dependence on external fields. 

Also, I simulated the two-photon driving scheme for population transition between hyperfine states.
